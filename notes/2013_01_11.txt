Phases of compilation
--------------------

  * Scanning
    -- Lexical analysis
    -- Do tokens exist correctly?
    -- Regular expressions

  * Parsing
    -- Syntax analysis
    -- Regular expressions can't do some things, like counting parenthesis
    -- Compiler uses rules to build a tree for entire program

  * Semantic analysis
    -- Discovery of meaning in the program

    -- Static
      * Meanings can be determined at compile time
      * Referencing undeclared variable

    -- Dynamic
      * Meaning isn't determined until run time.
      * Array out of bounds
